## How to use

Just open [decbin.html](./decbin.html) in your browser.  
Operate the switches and observe the resulting overall performance.  

## Project objectives

It is often very abstract for programming beginners to recognize the connection between dual and decimal numbers. This small example should help to overcome this hurdle.  
The example was developed for teaching at [Biondis Programmierschule](https://www.biondi.ch).
